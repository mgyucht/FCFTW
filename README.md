Computational Geometry final project

The `Key` module contains the workings of a triply-linked list, which is 
a doubly linked list in which different lists can share elements, allowing 
traversal across different lists. `key.ml` contains the source, and 
`key.pdf` is a pdf generated by `ocamldoc` and compiling the resulting 
LaTeX file.
